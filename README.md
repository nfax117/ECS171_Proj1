# ECS 171 SQ 2022 Final Project

#### The goal of this project is to predict the next market crash using a S\&P 500 data-set that has the details about the daily price from 1927-12-30 to 2021-09-19. This project would be beneficial to any heavy investors who are susceptible to major losses as it allows them to know ahead of time when the market crash would be, and also would provide major upside for an investor who is willing to invest heavily during the market crash prediction date of our project returns. 

#### We are using Keras' ANN model to conduct time series analysis on the SNP 500 stock market and try to predict the closing price of the stock.

## Interactive model
-- To use the interactive model, after installing the necessary libraries go into the "interactiveDemo" directory. Once inside run "python3 app.py" in the command line. Ensure that you are running python 3.7+ and all specified libraries are downloaded. Once finished compiling, it sets up the interactive demo website on your local machine. The link to it is printed on the terminal, copy and paste this to your chrome browser and you are now free to use the interactive website.
